function is special type of object with two hidden feature i.e., NAME(optional, can be anonymous) and code(can be invocable anytime)

function greet(){
    console.log("hi");
}

greet();

greet.language = "english";

on consoling the function, console.log(greet);
it will show

function greet(){
    console.log("hi");
}

but greet.language can be accessible directly

c = {greeting : 'Hi'}
value of c changes as equal operator sets up new memory space(new address) exception in reberence by value
c = {greeting : 'Hola'}

function inside a function with this points to global object that is a loophole in javascript that's why we use var self = this; to overcome the issue

function abc(){}
abc.moo = 1;

abc() == abc.call() // to stabilize the value of 'this'
